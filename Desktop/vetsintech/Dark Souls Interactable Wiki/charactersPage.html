                Master Logan was a famous Sorcerer and a royal <br>
                member of the Vinheim Dragon School before he <br>
                turned Undead about one hundred years ago. His <br>
                nickname stems from the gigantic hat he wore <br>
                which completely hid his face; he used it to <br>
                block the noise and stares from those around <br>
                him in order to focus his thoughts. His weapon <br>
                was once an ordinary catalyst employed by the <br>
                Sorcerers of Vinheim, but it has since been <br>
                strengthened due to lengthy use over time. <br>
                Similarly, his robe is one typically worn by <br>
                apprentices at Dragon School. <br>

                Logan is credited with having developed the Soul <br>
                Spear Sorcery, among others, which is referenced <br>
                repeatedly in the legends and is said to be on<br>
                par with Lord Gwyn's lightning. In his attempt to <br>
                reach Anor Londo, presumably to gain access to The <br>
                Duke's Archives and its vast store of endless <br>
                knowledge, he became imprisoned in Sen's Fortress, <br>
                where he first encounters the Chosen Undead.<br>
